<h1> Lyrics for the 6th Song of the Stand By Your Battles Album </h1>

<h3> Song Name: Truth of God </h3>

<h2> Lyrics: </h2>

<p>Are you caught up in all the lies that you have been told?</p>
<p>Are those lies leading you in the wrong direction?</p>
<p>Those lies have been changed into the Truths of God
<p>Lies mean nothing but changing lives!
<p>I've been hiding</p>
<p>Afraid I've let You down</p>
<p>Inside I doubt that You still love me</p>
<p>But in Your eyes there's only grace now</p>
<p>Sometimes, I, I just want to close my eyes</p>
<p>And act like everyone is alright when Godâ€™s Truth knows they are not</p>
<p>You say you could just say a prayer and move on,</p>
<p>Oh,-ooh, but God does greater things when you are lied to.</p>
<p>You laid down Your life</p>
<p>That I would be set free</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus, I sing for</p>
<p>All that You've done for me </p>
