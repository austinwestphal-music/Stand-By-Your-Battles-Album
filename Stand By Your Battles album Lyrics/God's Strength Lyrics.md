<h1> Lyrics for the Fourth Song in the Stand By Your Battles Album </h1>

<h3> Song Name: God's Strength </h3>

<h2>Lyrics: </h2>

<p>Have you ever felt that your weaknesses define who you are</p>
<p>Have you felt that God purposely gave you your weaknesses</p>
<p>You turned to heaven in desperation</p>
<p>You count on one thing, the Strength of God</p>
<p>God’s Power takes your weaknesses</p>
<p>And turns them into your strengths</p>
<p>So, When you fight, you’ll fight on your knees</p>
<p>Oh God, The Strengths Belong to you</p>
<p>There is no one like our God</p>
<p>Your strength is found in God</p>
<p>The cross has spoken You are forgiven</p>
<p>The King of Kings called you his child</p>
<p>God see’s your weaknesses as your strengths</p>
<p>Your weaknesses do not define who you are</p>
<p>God’s Strength will give you strength and power</p>
<p>There is nothing that God can’t do</p>
<p>Almighty Strength, You are above all else, Nothing can ever stop your Goodness</p>
<p>The God of Weaknesses stepped into your heart and gave you strength</p>
<p>You say I am strong when I think I am weak</p>
<p>You say God has my life in his hands when I don’t feel my life going anywhere</p>
<p>Your weaknesses are now strengths from God. </p>
