<h2> Lyrics: </h2>

<p>How long have you been praying</p>
<p>that someday God will answer you?</p>
<p>Have you been wondering what God has planned for you?</p>
<p>He already has your life planned out!</p>
<p>Oh, all you have to do,</p>
<p>Is just Believe in the Lord God!</p>
<p>You gave your life to give me mine,</p>
<p>Oh, you say all my sins are washed away.</p>
<p>But the only thing to do is,</p>
<p>Believe in the Lord God!</p>
<p>When I fall, you will lift me up,</p>
<p>You are for me, not against me! Yeah!</p>
<p>You correct my mistakes,</p>
<p>Just believe in the Lord God!</p>
<p>What does it take for God to hear me?</p>
<p>Don’t stop believing in the Lord God,</p>
<p>He is listening to you all the time!</p>
<p>Let the Lord God take your life,</p>
<p>And put it in his hands.</p>
<p>Just Believe in the Lord God!</p>
<p>You say that I am free,</p>
<p>When inside I feel that I am not.</p>
<p>Inside I feel that I am not loved,</p>
<p>You are the one that lives inside my heart,</p>
<p>You fill me with love!</p>
<p>All I did was Believe in the Lord God!</p>
<p>I thought you were just words on a page,</p>
<p>But I was wrong when I came to the point,</p>
<p>When I decided that I</p>
<p>Just Believed in the Lord God!</p>
<p>You gave up your one and only son,</p>
<p>To die on the cross for our sins.</p>
<p>You said that I will go to heaven at the end of my life,</p>
<p>I had doubts on that, I am sure everyone did.</p>
<p>Once I believed in the Lord God,</p>
<p>I noticed all my sins were washed away,</p>
<p>And that I will go to heaven at the end of my life!</p>
<p>You gave your life to give me mine,</p>
<p>You say all my sins are washed away.</p>
<p>But the only thing to do is,</p>
<p>Believe in the Lord God!</p>
<p>When I fall, you will lift me up,</p>
<p>You are for me, not against me!</p>
<p>You correct my mistakes,</p>
<p>Just believe in the Lord God!</p>
<p>What does it take for God to hear me?</p>
<p>Don’t stop believing in the Lord God,</p>
<p>He is listening to you all the time!</p>
<p>Let the Lord God take your life,</p>
<p>And put it in his hands.</p>
<p>Just Believe in the Lord God!</p>
<p>You say that I am free,</p>
<p>When inside I feel that I am not.</p>
<p>Inside I feel that I am not loved,</p>
<p>You are the one that lives inside my heart,</p>
<p>You fill me with love!</p>
<p>All I did was Believe in the Lord God!</p>
