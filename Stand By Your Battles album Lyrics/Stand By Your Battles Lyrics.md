<h2>Lyrics:</h2>
<p>Whenever you feel alone, there is one person,</p>
<p>The one person you can always count on.</p>
<p>He forgives all your sins, and knows what to do,</p>
<p>God will stand by your battles, oh yes, he will!</p>
<p>Shout to the Lord as loud as you can,</p>
<p>The battle will be taken into the Lord’s hands.</p>
<p>If you are fighting a battle, just know that</p>
<p>God is there to help you win the battle.</p>
<p>Psalm 13:6 says, “I will sing to the Lord,</p>
<p>Because he has dealt bountifully with me.”</p>
<p>You say you are okay, but you really aren’t,</p>
<p>God will stand by your battles, because he loves you!</p>
<p>If you come up to an obstacle, God moves the obstacle.</p>
<p>Whatever you are experiencing, no matter what it is,</p>
<p>Don’t fear, but trust in God!</p>
<p>The battle is taken over by the Lord,</p>
<p>James 5:13 once said, “Is anyone among you suffering?</p>
<p>Let him pray, Is anyone cheerful?</p>
<p>Let him sing praise.”</p>
<p>Don’t let your fears get in the way,</p>
<p>Because, God is there next to your battles.</p>
<p>If you are fighting a battle, oh, just know that,</p>
<p>God is there to help you win the battle, oh yes, he is!</p>
<p>God will stand by your battles, oh yes, he will!</p>
<p>God is not dead, because he is living for you!</p>
<p>Luke 19:40 says, “He answered,</p>
<p>I tell you, if these were silent,</p>
<p>The very stones would cry out.”</p>
<p>He takes that frown and turns it upside down,</p>
<p>So, live life the way God wants you to!</p>
