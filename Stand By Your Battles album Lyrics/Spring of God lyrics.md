<h2> Lyrics: </h2>

<p>I want to drink God’s Eternal Waters,</p>
<p>At the whence of God’s Springs that are free.</p>
<p>The Goodness of God is good,</p>
<p>Oh, It is good indeed!</p>
<p>I give my heart to God,</p>
<p>God will wash my sins away with Eternal Waters.</p>
<p>The goodness of God’s Forgiveness is powerful,</p>
<p>The Spring of God is God’s Powerful Forgiveness!</p>
<p>The Spring of God gives me an everlasting life</p>
<p>Leaving me to Trust in the Spring of God.</p>
<p>When I don’t see forgiveness</p>
<p>God see’s all forgiveness.</p>
<p>Oh-ooh, Eternal waters is the grace of God!</p>
<p>When I need a mountain moved,</p>
<p>God will move that mountain.</p>
<p>When I feel weak,</p>
<p>The Spring of God gives me Strength!</p>
<p>I want to drink God’s Eternal Waters,</p>
<p>At the whence of God’s Springs that are free.</p>
<p>The Goodness of God is good,</p>
<p>Oh, It is good indeed!</p>
<p>I give my heart to God,</p>
<p>God will wash my sins away with Eternal Waters.</p>
<p>The goodness of God’s Forgiveness is powerful,</p>
<p>The Spring of God is God’s Powerful Forgiveness! </p>
